# Drug Overdose Deaths
 
The persistent issue of drug overdose in the United States has gained substantial attention over the past five decades. The allocation of 42.5 billion USD in the 2023 federal budget, an increase from the prior year, underscores its severity. The year 2022 witnessed over 79,000 deaths due to drug overdoses, surpassing fatalities from accidents, homicides, and suicides. Although estimated deaths slightly decreased from 2021, the numbers remained 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. The misuse of prescription medication, particularly in Connecticut, plays a pivotal role, prompting a comprehensive exploration as part of my research.
